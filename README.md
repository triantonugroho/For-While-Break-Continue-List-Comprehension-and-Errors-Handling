# For-While-Break-Continue-List-Comprehension-and-Errors-Handling

## For
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

## While
A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true. The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is âˆ’ Here, statement (s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value.

## Break
The break statement in Python terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement. The most common use for break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit from a loop.

## Continue
The continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the while loop. The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop. The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops

## List Comprehension
List comprehension is how to create a new list in a short way based on an existing list.
- List comprehension without ***if*** condition
- List comprehension with ***if*** condition
- List comprehension with *Nested Loops*

## Errors in Python
Python has two types of errors based on their occurrence
- Syntax Errors
- Logical Errors (exceptions)

## Exceptions 
The exception handling process uses a try statement paired with except.
- ZeroDivisionError:
  ZeroDivisionError is an exception that occurs when program execution results in a mathematical calculation of division by zero.
- FileNotFoundError:
  FileNotFoundError is an exception that occurs when the file to be open does not exist.
- TypeError:
  Unsupported operand type for mathematical calculation with different data types  
  
## Exceptions Handling
- Handling ZeroDivisionError:
  Exception handling for ZeroDivisionError is using try and except ZeroDivisionError and print the error pop-up message to the screen.
- Handling FileNotFoundError:
  Exception handling for FileNotFoundError is using try, with ... as, except and print the pop-up error message to the screen.
- Handling TypeError:
  To handle TypeError (exception) use try, single or double except's statement and print the pop-up error message to the screen.
